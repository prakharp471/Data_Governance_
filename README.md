Curated documents exploring database security, compliance risks, and enterprise governance strategies.

**Database_Security_Case_Study_Optus.pdf** This report offers a thorough examination of common data security vulnerabilities within enterprise environments and presents targeted mitigation strategies. It identifies issues such as weak password protocols, insecure USB usage, outdated systems, and susceptibility to phishing, recommending practices like full-disk encryption, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and secure cloud-based alternatives. The report culminates in a detailed analysis of the 2022 Optus data breach, outlining how poor API security and access controls led to one of Australiaâ€™s largest data leaks. The case study evaluates the technical causes, business consequences, and proposes a set of preventative strategies such as role-based access control, regular penetration testing, and incident response readiness. The report bridges theoretical knowledge with practical application in real-world cybersecurity settings.

**Database_Fundamentals_Learning_Summary:** This reflective report captures a foundational understanding of relational database systems, their design principles, and broader implications in enterprise data governance. It outlines core concepts like schema normalisation, entity-relationship modelling, SQL query construction, and the rationale behind database constraints. The report also explores cloud-based architectures through a discussion on Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS), comparing traditional on-premise databases with scalable cloud solutions. It reflects on the governance challenges associated with data storage, access management, and compliance in cloud contexts. Overall, this document summarises a learning journey through both technical skills and strategic insights into how databases operate as secure, governed components of modern digital systems.
